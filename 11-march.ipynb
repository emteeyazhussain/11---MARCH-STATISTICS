It is a range of values that is constructed based on a sample statistic and is used to estimate the true population parameter with a certain level of confidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of a confidence interval involves several components, including the sample size, sample mean or proportion, standard deviation or standard error, and the chosen level of confidence. The most common level of confidence used is 95%, which means that if the same experiment were repeated many times, the true population parameter would be expected to lie within the confidence interval in 95% of the cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let's say a researcher wants to estimate the average height of adult males in a certain population. The researcher takes a random sample of 100 men from the population and calculates their average height, which is 175 cm. The researcher also knows from previous studies that the standard deviation of height in this population is 10 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "To calculate a 95% confidence interval for the population mean height, the researcher first needs to calculate the standard error of the mean, which is the standard deviation of the sample divided by the square root of the sample size. In this case, the standard error would be 10/sqrt(100) = 1 cm.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the researcher needs to determine the critical value for a 95% confidence interval using a t-distribution table or calculator with 99 degrees of freedom (n-1). For a 95% confidence interval and 99 degrees of freedom, the critical value is approximately 1.984.\n",

    "Finally, the researcher can calculate the confidence interval by adding and subtracting the margin of error, which is the product of the standard error and the critical value, from the sample mean. In this case, the confidence interval would be 175 +/- (1.984 x 1) cm, or 175 +/- 1.984 cm, which gives a range of 173.02 cm to 176.98 cm.\n",

    "P(not A) = 1 - P(A) = 0.9999 (probability of not having the disease)\n",
